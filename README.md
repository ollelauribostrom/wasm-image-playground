# WebAssembly Image Playground
Play around with Image Processing and Object Detection using WebAssembly. 

> https://wasm-image-playground.now.sh/

Benchmarks
----------
The application contains a number of easy-to-run benchmarks, comparing JavaScript vs. WebAssembly
performance for some Image Processing / Object Detection related [use cases](http://webassembly.org/docs/use-cases/)
identified by the WebAssembly Community Group. Currently, benchmarks are available for the use cases
Image editing, Image recognition and Live video augmentation.  

- WebAssembly implementations are using [OpenCv]() compiled to WebAssembly.
- JavaScript implementations are using an ES6 rewrite of [HAAR.js](https://github.com/foo123/HAAR.js/) (which is a JavaScript port of OpenCV C++ Haar Detection) and some parts of [Tracking.js](https://github.com/eduardolundgren/tracking.js).
- Both versions are using the same Haar Cascades.
- Image processing are done using Web Workers to avoid blocking the main thread
